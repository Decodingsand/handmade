    bio: 'I create functional ceramics with clean lines and muted colors. Each piece is hand-thrown and designed to bring simple elegance to everyday moments.',
    story: 'My journey with ceramics began during college when I took an elective pottery class. What started as a way to de-stress quickly evolved into a passion. After completing my design degree, I established my Portland studio where I focus on creating pieces that enhance daily rituals. My work is influenced by Japanese minimalism and Scandinavian design principles.',

    bio: 'My work explores the relationship between natural textures and geometric forms. I find inspiration in landscapes and translate those elements into tactile ceramics.',
    story: "Before becoming a full-time ceramicist, I worked as an architect for 12 years. That background informs my approach to clayâ€”I see each piece as a small architectural form. My Brooklyn studio is housed in a converted industrial space where I experiment with various textures and glazing techniques. I'm particularly drawn to the interplay between rough and smooth surfaces, often incorporating elements from urban environments and natural landscapes.",

    story: "Growing up in a family of artists, creativity has always been at the center of my life. I studied fine arts with a focus on sculpture before discovering my love for ceramics. My Austin studio is a colorful, energetic space where I blend traditional techniques with contemporary designs. I'm constantly experimenting with new glazes and forms, drawing inspiration from the vibrant street art and music scene that makes Austin so unique.
